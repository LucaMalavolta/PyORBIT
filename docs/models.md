# Dataset modeling

These models will use a mixture of *common parameters* and *dataset-specific
parameters* to model a dataset

```{note}
All the parameters are inherited from the *common models*, where the boundaries and other properties are defined. The distinction between *common parameter* and *dataset parameter* happen at this stage and can be changed for each model
