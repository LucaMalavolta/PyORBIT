Installation
============

Requirements
++++++++++++

This is the list of packages required by PyORBIT to work out-of-the-box:

- ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib``: pretty standard
- ``argparse``:
- ``pyyaml``: YAML is the language used for the configuration file
- ``pyDE``: global optimization package (`PyDE home page`_)
- ``emcee``: ensemble sampling toolkit for affine-invariant MCMC (`emcee home page`_)

The ``PyDE`` + ``emcee`` combination is the easiest to install and set up, but it is possible to specifiy the starting point of ``emcee`` instead of using the outcome of ``PyDE``.
It is possible to use other sapler as well,

- ``MultiNEST``
- ``PolyChord``


Additional packages may be required to perform certain types of analysis:

- ``corner``: to make corner plots (`corner.py home page`_)
- ``cython`` : C extension for Python (`Cython home page`_)
- ``george`` : Fast and flexible Gaussian Process regression in Python (`george home page`_)
- ``celerite`` : scalable 1D Gaussian Processes (`celerite home page`_)
- ``TRADES`` : dynamical simulation of exoplanetary systems (`TRADES home page`_)
- ``TTVfast`` : transit times for and radial velocities for n-planet systems (`TTVfast home page`_)

Instructions
++++++++++++

``pyDE``
--------

Installing from pip results in an error, so you have to install from source using the following commands:

.. code:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/hpparvi/PyDE.git
  cd PyDE
  python setup.py install

From the `pyDE source repository`_

.. _pyDE source repository: https://github.com/hpparvi/PyDE

``emcee``
---------

Iâ€™m currently using the latest version of emcee (Version 3.0 at the moment of writing), installed from the source repository:

.. code:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/dfm/emcee.git
  cd emcee
  python setup.py install

(from here: http://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/install.html#from-source)



Additional codes
++++++++++++++++

The following codes may be required to do some specific kind of analysis.

``george``
----------

Please refer to the `george installation page`_ for detailed instruction on your preferred method of installation.
At the time of writing this guide, using conda installed version 0.3.1 of the package.

.. code:: bash

  conda install -c conda-forge george

Please check that your installed version is equal or higher than ``3.0``:

::

  import george
  george.__version__


.. _george installation page: http://george.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#installation

``celerite``
------------

Follow the instructions at `celerite installation page`_

.. _celerite installation page: http://celerite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/install/


``PolyChord``
-------------

Download the code at `PolyChord home page`_ .
I tested the code with version 1.12, earlier version have a different Python interface and may not work.

.. code:: bash

  tar -xvf PolyChord_v1.12.tar.gz
  cd PolyChord/

Change the Makefile appropriately if you are using weird C/Fortran compilers or Linux architecture. For ``anaconda2`` and ``Ubuntu 16.04 LTS`` I didn't have to change any setting. Then run ``make`` to build the code.

The next step is to configure your ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to point to your PolyChord installation, and your ``LD_PRELOAD`` to point to your mpi installation. PolyChord will tell you the exact line to be added to your ``~\.bashrc`` file by executing:

.. code:: bash

  python run_PyPolyChord.py

Remeber to load the modified ``~\.bashrc`` file by running ``source ~\.bashrc`` in a terminal.


Finally, to use the MPI functionalities, prepend the MPI command before the python one, specyfying the number of processor you want to use after ``-np`` (20 in the example).

.. code:: bash

  mpirun -np 20 python run_PyPolyChord.py

If you already ran the command without the MPI instruction or with a different number of CPU, remember to delete the ``chains`` directory or the execution will fail.

*Troubleshooting*

If you get the following errors when executing ``run_PyPolyChord.py`` , your MPI/OpenMPI installation is likely broken and you have to re-install it. You need to have a working MPI installation even when you are using PolyChord in single-CPU mode!

.. code:: bash

  [ghoul:30446] [[INVALID],INVALID] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: A system-required executable either could not be found or was not executable by this user in file ess_singleton_module.c at line 231
  [ghoul:30446] [[INVALID],INVALID] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: A system-required executable either could not be found or was not executable by this user in file ess_singleton_module.c at line 140
  [ghoul:30446] [[INVALID],INVALID] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: A system-required executable either could not be found or was not executable by this user in file runtime/orte_init.c at line 128

In my case, I decided to re-build `OpenMPI`_ by following these `instructions <https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building>`_. Be sure to modify the ``LD_PRELOAD`` in your ``~\.bashrc`` accordingly.
If you are not able to fix the problem, you can still run PolyChord without using the MPI/OpenMPI support (but be ready to wait a lot of time when executing a program...). Open the ``Makefile`` file end switch the MPI flag to zero:

.. code:: bash

  # Whether to use MPI
  MPI=1

then run:

.. code:: bash

  make veryclean
  make


If you get the following error when executing ``mpirun -np 20 python run_PyPolyChord.py`` :

.. code:: bash

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  It seems that there is no lamd running on the host.

  This indicates that the LAM/MPI runtime environment is not operating.
  The LAM/MPI runtime environment is necessary for the "mpirun" command.

  Please run the "lamboot" command the start the LAM/MPI runtime
  environment.  See the LAM/MPI documentation for how to invoke
  "lamboot" across multiple machines.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then check if the mpirun executable belongs to the same installation of the library that have been used to compile PolyChord.
For example, in my case I re-installed OpenMPI in the directory ``/home/malavolta/CODE/others/openmpi_dir`` . This is how ```LD_PRELOAD`` is configured in my ``~\.bashrc`` file:

.. code:: bash

  export LD_PRELOAD=/home/malavolta/CODE/others/openmpi_dir/lib/libmpi.so:$LD_PRELOAD
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/malavolta/CODE/others/PolyChord/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

I have to add the path of the binaries of my OpenMPI installation
The correct ``mpirun`` is:

.. code:: bash

  $ which mpirun
  /home/malavolta/CODE/others/openmpi_dir/bin/mpirun

If your ``mpirun`` is not coming from the same installation directory of your MPI libraries, add to the ``PATH`` environment variable the ``bin`` directory of the MPI distribution you are crrently using, at the end of your ``~\.bashrc`` file:

.. code:: bash

  export PATH=/home/malavolta/CODE/others/openmpi_dir/bin:$PATH
