# Quickstart

Although it started as a simple program, `PyORBIT` got increasingly complex with time.
Before you start delving into the many available models, letâ€™s work together on a simple test case to better understand the philosophy behind `PyORBIT`. In this first example, we will fit just the radial velocity measurements of HD189733 from
[Bouchy et al. 2006](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...444L..15B/abstract).

To get started, we need two ingredients: the **dataset**, and a **configuration file**.

## Dataset

The radial velocity dataset is just a text file with five columns, as in this example:

```
#epoch value error jitter_flag offset_flag
  2453611.419560   -2229.0   5.1   0   0
  2453613.430197   -2156.0   5.1   0   0
  2453614.434525   -2575.0   5.1   0   0
```

- 1<sup>st</sup> column: epoch of the observation, expressed in BJD_TDB
- 2<sup>nd</sup> column: radial velocity measurements at the given epoch, in metre per second
- 3<sup>rd</sup> column: error associated to the measurement, again in metre per second
- 4<sup>th</sup> column: flag to activate the jitter parameter(s)
- 5<sup>th</sup> column: flag to activate the offset parameter(s)

The **jitter** is a value added in quadrature to the error estimates to take into account underestimated error bars.

The **offset** is constant value added to the model - in this case it corresponds to the systemic velocity of the star.

Folllowing the Python notation,  **0** activates a flag, **-1** deactives it.

Other flags and ancillary data can be included, as detailed in the [Prepare a dataset file](prepare_dataset)

## Configuration file

The configuration file is again just a text file that you can modify with any editor, this time written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) language.
Similarly to Python, indentation is quite important, and it is the major cause of errors for beginners. Whitespace is part of YAML's formatting, with *tabs* specifically forbidden by the language's specifications.

Given the simple model we are going to fit - it's just a sinusoid after all - the configuration file may seem rather complex!
This structure reflects the logical organization of PyORBIT, and it will become extremely useful with increasingly more complex models.

Look at the example below:

```{code-block} yaml
:lineno-start: 1

inputs:
    Bouchy2005_RV01_noRML:
        file: Bouchy2005_RV01_noRML_PyORBIT.dat
        kind: RV
        models:
        - radial_velocities
common:
    planets:
        b:
            orbit: circular
            boundaries:
                P: [0.50, 5.0]
                K: [0.01, 300.0]
    star:
        star_parameters:
            priors:
                mass: ['Gaussian', 0.806, 0.048]
models:
    radial_velocities:
        planets:
            - b
parameters:
    Tref: 2459500.00
solver:
    pyde:
        ngen: 50000
        npop_mult: 4
    emcee:
        npop_mult: 4
        nsteps: 20000
        nburn: 10000
        thin: 100
    nested_sampling:
        nlive: 1000
    recenter_bounds: True
```

You can see that there are five main sections:
- ``inputs``: the properties of each dataset are enclosed within a dedicated subsection.
- ``common``: it encompasses two subsections, *planets* and *star*, where you list the characteristics of the objects that will be common to all the models.
- ``models``: any model used to fit your data, to be recalled in the ``model`` subsection of the dataset
- ``parameters``: values that are not system parameters per se, but are required to properly perform the analysis.
- ``solver``: the parameters required by the samplers are all listed here.

In this example, we will fit the ``Bouchy2005_RV01_noRML`` dataset with ``radial_velocity`` model encompassing only the planet ``b``. Note that the stellar mass is used only to convert the RV semi-amplitude into physical mass, while keeping into account the error associated to the stellar mass itself.

## Launch PyORBIT

Analyzing your dataset with `PyORBIT` is a two-step process: you first run the actual analysis, and then you extract the relevant information (posteriors distributions of the derived parameters, corner plots...).

If you have installed `PyORBIT` through pip (from PyPI or from the local repository), just run this command on your terminal:

```{code} bash
pyorbit_run emcee configuration_file.yaml
```
The first argument of `pyorbit_run` is the sampler to be used in the analysis (see [Samplers](samplers)), the second argument is the configuration file.

PyORBIT will produce a very extensive terminal output, detailed in the section [Interpreting the output](results_interpretation).

To save the terminal output to a file,   `> configuration_file_emcee_res.log` the terminal output will be saved to a file.
