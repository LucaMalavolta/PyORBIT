# Quickstart 

Although it started as a simple program, `PyORBIT` got increasingly complex with time. 
Before you start delving into the many available models, letâ€™s work together on a simple test case to better understand the philosophy behind `PyORBIT`. In this first example, we will fit just the radial velocity measurements of HD189733 from
[Bouchy et al. 2006](insert_ads_link). 

To get started, we need two ingredients: the **dataset**, and a **configuration file**. 

The dataset is just a text file with six columns
