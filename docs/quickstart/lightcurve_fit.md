# Light curve fit

We will start this example by considering the [TESS](https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite) light curve of HD189733, also known as [TOI 4470](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/target.php?id=256364928). 

For the purposes of this example, the light curve has been already *flattened* using `w≈çtan` [Hippke et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....158..143H/abstract), although one could perform light curve flattening within `PyORBIT` as well.

## Dataset 

Light curve datasets differ from radial velocity or activity datasets for a fundamental aspect: the effect of planets or stellar activity is a *multiplicative* effect, rather than *additive*. For example, a Jupiter-like transiting a Sun-like star will cause a drop in light of about 1% regardless of the absolute value of the flux recorded on the ground. Thus, removing an additive offset from the light curve would inevitably affect the observed transit depth. For this reason, a light curve dataset *must always have* the offset flag deactivated:

```
#epoch value error jitter_flag offset_flag
  2459422.028697         0.999750         0.000205 0 -1
  2459422.030086         1.000049         0.000205 0 -1
  2459422.031475         1.000001         0.000205 0 -1
...
```

This is equivalent in writing:
```
#epoch value error jitter_flag
  2459422.028697         0.999750         0.000205 0
  2459422.030086         1.000049         0.000205 0
  2459422.031475         1.000001         0.000205 0
...
```

Keep in mind that **0** activates a flag, **-1** deactives it, folllowing the Python notation, while the absence of a column automatically deactivate a flag.

There is a lot to process:

**Orbit parametrization** 

**Stellar density** is expressed in Solar units, so a star with one Solar mass and one Solar radius will have a density equal to one. If you know mass anda radius of a star in Solar units, then the density will be simply $\rho_\star = M_\star / R_\star^3$, without multiplicative constants.

**Limb darkening** coefficients are included under the `star` common model for conceptual reasons, although you must remeber that lightcurves obtained with different filters will require specific limb darkening paramters. When using a *quadratic* limb darkening law, you can use the parametrization introduced by [Kipping](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435.2152K/abstract) cby simply activating the flag as in the example

**Light curve modellling** can be performed either with `batman` ([Kreidberg 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PASP..127.1161K/abstract)) or `PyTransit` ([Pairviainen 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07433)). You can choose the model by specifying `batman_transit` or `pytransit_transit` respectively.
